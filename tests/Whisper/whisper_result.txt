We're in Stanwell, Surrey, a village now divided by vitriol. Our army, our military, our soldiers come back from war and what they've got nothing, they're sleeping on the streets, some of them. These are put in hotels. Do I feel that a lot of their fears have been hijacked by the racists? Absolutely. The local hotel, once the heart of the village, is now the centre of nightly protests, because of the asylum seekers who've been housed here. Which bit is actually the hotel loan? Literally, behind the fence. 29 years ago, me and my husband had already reception in there. I've had my dad's wake in there, my nann's wake in there. Can you give me an example of one of the things that's happened that you think shouldn't be going on? Cannabis smoking. Sometimes me and my husband can't sit in the garden because we can smell the cannabis. Up until recently, the hotel was home to families of asylum seekers, but locals are angry that they're being replaced with single men. Sometimes you can get up to 10 walking through down the road. All of a sudden it's just changed the feel of the village. Why do you feel more concerned about asylum seekers walking down the road in the village than you do about any other man that you might meet? So obviously being a small village, we know everyone in the village. So to then have gangs of sort of, or individual men walking around that we don't know, it just makes you feel very uneasy. Look what you're doing! For others, it is the protests that caused discomfort. You were right here! You were right here! You were right here! You were right here! You were right here! People like you! Across the country, we wanted to analyse the fears, but also the fantasies about asylum seekers living in luxury. Here in Blackpool, this whistleblower says she saw the exact opposite that the hotel she once worked in. There are rats everywhere. Raw sewage was coming up through the drains. Leaks, profusely, all over the place. Nobody needs to be staying in those conditions at all. Circo runs the hotel and says it's been fixed. But this family of asylum seekers say they've gone from danger in Jordan, fleeing political persecution, to demonisation in Blackpool, where protesters stand outside their hotel. We didn't come here to look in for luxury, or to look in for, take your rights from you. We came here looking for save, looking for goody blaze. We are not here to steal your country from you. What are some of the things that have happened to you at the hotel? One of people, strong, that they are, they are my head. One of people, woman, shaft of me. And, and so, bad, bad word. Till me, f***ing woman. Why? Almost no one seems to benefit from the use of hotels. By housing many, seeking safety, they have made others feel less secure. Paul Brandt, ITV News.
